                <h1 class="fw-bolder text-center">Privacy and Terms</h1>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-center mb-0">Below is the privacy policy for accessing this website and also the terms and conditions for the EncodeGUI and FrameGUI software.</p><br /><br />
				<h3 class="fw-bolder text-right">EncodeGUI/FrameGUI Patron terms and conditions</h1>
				<p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">Patrons have the privilege to early access updates, priority support, and a special recognition of their subscription on Discord. Apart from the terms and conditions on Patreon, below are the terms and conditions for being a patron of EncodeGUI and FrameGUI.</p><br />
				<p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• The early access updates to EncodeGUI and FrameGUI are considered beta releases. There could be issues or bugs in the beta releases. Your contributions by being a patron does NOT guarantee that there will be no issues or bugs in the early access releases. We encourage patrons to report such issues or bugs to the developer so that patches can be promptly released.</p>
				<p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• You may cancel your subscription at any time for any reason.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• NO WARRANTY IS PROVIDED WITH ANY EARLY ACCESS RELEASE, including the implied warranty of merchantability. The developer of EncodeGUI and FrameGUI is never responsible for the loss of information from destructive functions or bugs in EncodeGUI and FrameGUI.</p>
				<p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• You are not permitted to share or distribute any information or files received from being a patron. Any information or files received from being a patron must remain confidential to the best of your abilities.</p>
				<p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• The source code for EncodeGUI and FrameGUI early access updates will remain confidential until the early access period for the updates is over.</p>
				<p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• In accordance with the Patreon terms and conditions, you are not permitted to sell your subscription or share your subscription with multiple individuals.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• You MUST have an active subscription on Patreon in order use EncodeGUI and/or FrameGUI. Canceling your subscription, regardless of accessibility status in Patreon will disable your access to use the early access updates until you renew. Renewal fees enforced by Patreon in this instance may apply.</p>
				<p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• The developer reserves the right to modify the benefits for the EncodeGUI/FrameGUI Patreon subscription or these terms at any time, for any reason, and without notification.</p><br /><br />
				<p class="fw-normal text-black text-right"><strong>How your data is managed at EncodeGUI.com:</strong></p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• Upon registering as a patron on Patreon, we collect the following information: your full name, status of payment (declined, success, etc.), total payment amount (since start of patronage), your Patreon tier, and your email address used to register. This information is copied to a database outside of Patreon to allow services such as the built-in authentication systems in EncodeGUI/FrameGUI to operate properly.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• The information that you provide to us during Patreon registration is NEVER sold or shared to any third party entities under any circumstances. We value patrons' privacy and will keep your information confidential to the best of our abilities.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• We are unaware of ANYTHING regarding your payment details or payment method. All we know is if the payment was successful, how much funds you have paid, and the date at which you last paid. Patreon manages and collects all other payment info and manages it per their terms and conditions. Please DO NOT contact us regarding payment issues as it is simply out of our control and doing so could breach your privacy. Contact Patreon support for anything related to payment issues.</p><br /><br />
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right"><strong>How the authentication system works:</strong></p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• EncodeGUI/FrameGUI requires an ACTIVE Patreon membership to use, not just to install.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• You will need an internet connection each time you start up EncodeGUI/FrameGUI. After 10 seconds has passed from start-up, EncodeGUI/FrameGUI will not use the internet and you can use it offline thereafter. If no internet connection is present at start-up or there is an error connecting, you will get an error message and then the app will close. Please contact the developer if you are experiencing issues.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• Canceling your Patreon membership or lowering your tier level to "Channel Supporter" will prevent you from using the early access update until you renew, regardless of your accessibility status or payment period in Patreon (this should eventually be changed to where you would still have access until your payment period has ended, but currently there is no way for me to programmatically determine this).</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• In order for EncodeGUI/FrameGUI to only require the email address entry once, your email address must be stored on your computer. EncodeGUI/FrameGUI encrypts your email address and stores it locally on your computer. Once you open the app again, EncodeGUI/FrameGUI will decrypt the email address saved from your last successful entry and will send it to the servers on EncodeGUI.com for verification. Any data that is transmitted between EncodeGUI/FrameGUI and the server is always encrypted using SSL.</p><br /><br />
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right"><strong>Refund policy:</strong></p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">Refunds are generally not offered. Only in very special circumstances are refunds offered and it is ultimately up to the developer for when this is necessary. Below are examples of invalid reasons where we will NOT offer refunds (non-exhaustive):</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• Forgetting to cancel your Patreon membership prior to the renewal date, when you didn't want to renew.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• EncodeGUI/FrameGUI doesn't work on your computer. Patrons are expected read the system requirements in the EncodeGUI/FrameGUI documentation and (if available) try the free/old versions of EncodeGUI/FrameGUI relative to their operating system prior to subscribing as a patron to confirm that the software works on their computer.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• Specific features currently exclusive to patron early access releases don't work or do not work as intended. As stated earlier in these terms, EncodeGUI/FrameGUI early access releases are beta releases and may contain bugs or other problems. Patrons are expected to report such issues to the developer so that they can be patched and re-released promptly.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• A new update was not released in a (or multiple) payment period. While we try to release a new update for either EncodeGUI or FrameGUI at least each month, we can not guarentee it.</p>
                <p class="fw-normal text-black text-right">• Additional renewal fees where you have canceled and renewed your subscription within a payment period.</p><br /><br />
                <h3 class="fw-bolder text-right">EncodeGUI/FrameGUI Free terms and conditions</h1>
